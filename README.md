# Multi-Indicator-Trading-Strategy

 This Pine Script code is an implementation of a trading indicator strategy in TradingView. The strategy combines signals from four different technical indicators (Exponential Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Fisher Transform, and MACD) to generate buy and sell signals for a financial instrument, typically a stock or cryptocurrency

Indicator Name and Overlay: This script defines an indicator called "4 Indicator Signal Strategy" and sets it to overlay on the price chart.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Signal Function: The ema_signal() and ema_signal_pre() functions calculate EMA values for different time periods (20, 50, 100, and 200) and use these values to determine buy and sell signals based on specific conditions.

Bollinger Bands Signal Function: The bollingerBandsSignal() function calculates Bollinger Bands and generates buy and sell signals based on the width of the bands and their relationship to the closing price.

Fisher Transform Signal Function: The fisherTransformSignal() function computes the Fisher Transform indicator and generates buy and sell signals based on certain thresholds and crossovers.

MACD Signal Function: The macdSignal() function calculates the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and generates buy and sell signals based on the MACD histogram and its relationship to zero.

Signal Conditions: The script defines various conditions for each of the four indicators, resulting in different signal types such as "Strong Buy," "Weak Buy," "Strong Sell," "Weak Sell," or "No Signal."

Plotting Buy and Sell Signals: The plotshape() function is used to plot different shapes (e.g., triangles) on the chart to indicate buy and sell signals. These signals are based on the conditions specified in the script.

Table for Signal Summary: The script creates a table to display a summary of the signals generated by each indicator. It lists the indicators and their corresponding signals in the table.

Table Population: The script populates the table with data, including the indicator names and the signals they generate based on the current market conditions.

In summary, this Pine Script combines signals from four technical indicators to create a comprehensive trading strategy. It visually represents buy and sell signals on the price chart and provides a summary of these signals in a table for quick reference. Traders can use this strategy as a tool for making trading decisions in the TradingView platform.
